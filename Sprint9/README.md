## Sprint 9: Vactory - Decoupled

This sprint is all about understanding how to use Drupal as a backend for a Next.js frontend, giving you the power to create dynamic and performant web applications. It's like learning to cook with a modern kitchen â€“ using the best tools to create amazing dishes.

- In the first part of the project we created a simple Drupale 10 project.
  Then we added a front-end component using Next.js with our already existing project Drupal following the [docs](https://next-drupal.org/) and fixing errors on high caffeine along the way.

- Then we will use vactory as backend with nextjs as frontend we follow the instructions in here: [TheNextDrupal](https://thenextdrupal.com/learn/quick-start/install-drupal)
